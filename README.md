## Who can use it?
If you're ready to design a web page with tennis draw, meanwhile, you don't know how to make it, you can refer to my php/css code and use it into your project.

## How to use
You can set a 2 to the power of N to "$int_player_total" as 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, etc. 

## Note
It's very simple, useful draw generator, you might as well use it with PDF library, you can output a printable draw for your project. BTW, you need to integrate your player coordiante into this draw generator.
